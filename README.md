An programming language

This language supports object-oriented-programming, first-class function, anonymous function, and others.
An remarkable feature of this language is supporting uncertainty.
For example,
(Meta language)
f(x) = {return x*2}
f(2) -> 4
f(vector[1 2]) -> vector[2 4]
scalar g(scalar int x) = {return x*2}
g(12) -> 24
g(vector[1 2]) -> Erorr,data type of given data was not matched with defined type.
(Meta language end)
